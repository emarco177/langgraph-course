## üöÄ  What You'll Build

- **Agentic RAG** ‚Äì Retrieval-Augmented Generation with self-correction & adaptive routing  
- **ReAct Agent** ‚Äì Reasoning + Acting loop implemented in LangGraph  
- **Reflection & Reflexion Agents** ‚Äì Agents that critique and improve themselves  
- **Multi-Step Graphs** ‚Äì Complex flows with conditionals, parallelism, and web-search tools
